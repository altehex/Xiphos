This doc helps getting started with contribuitng to ThanatOS. It covers the build system, the repository structure, calling conventions, languages, etc.

|   BUILDING THANATOS
+-------------------------------*
The build system is presented as the series of bash scripts, the main script is ./build.sh.

Dependencies:
- bash 
- gcc or clang
- fasm

All you need to do is:
```bash
./build.sh

```


|   SUPPORTED TARGETS
+-------------------------------*
The only supported target now is x86_64. ARM support is planned.



|   REPOSITORY FILE TREE STRUCTURE
+-------------------------------*
|- /boot - bootloader, kernel initialization code;
|- /firmware - BIOS/UEFI, ACPI related stuff;
|- /include - headers;
|- /kernel - the "meat";
|- /src - source code to be ditched and reimplemented in some other way. This mainly includes third-party library dependencies(it is preferable to keep the project as standalone as possible);
+- /util - utilities for building the source.


|   PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES
+-------------------------------*
The main language of the kernel and the bootloader is C. Additional modules can be written in C++.

Usage of the following languages may be possible in the future:
- Pascal
- Forth
- Ada
- Rust


|   DON'T BE A DICK
+-------------------------------*
